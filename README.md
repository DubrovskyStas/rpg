# Console RPG 
## Getting started
### Prerequisites
Need to install `maven` to run some tests before 
### Installing
Just run a jar 

For example
`java -jar rpg-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar `


Also you can setup directory where backups are located via `-Dbackup.path`

For example
`java -jar -Dbackup.path=/some/location rpg-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar `

By default backups are stored to `user.home` directory. File named `rpg.bkp`
